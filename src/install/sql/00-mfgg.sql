Here&#39;s what&#39;s changed in the update:<br /><br /><u>Features:</u><br />- FEATURE: Sort by average score for games, which is displayed in the listing. See average on game&#39;s page as well.<br />- FEATURE: Ability to directly visit your submission&#39;s page, or download your submission, from the &quot;My Submissions&quot; directory.<br />- FEATURE: Option to hide thumbnails in listing.<br />- FEATURE: ACP - When admins close reports or messages to staff, the user can now be informed of the resolution.<br /><br /><u>Bugs Fixed:</u><br />- SITE: If a user&#39;s HTTP_REFERER is masked, they cannot download files.<br />- SITE: Some browsers will not properly download binary files tagged with an &#39;inline&#39; disposition.<br />- SITE: Some typo fixes<br />- SITE: Unable to view or download your own submissions when they were queued.<br />- SITE: Submissions could still be downloaded when they were queued, by going directly to the download URL.<br />- SITE: Thumbnail dimentions were sometimes missing without a proper fallback, thus causing staff icons to vanish.<br />- SKIN: Division between header and sidebar in the New MFGG Skin for IE users.<br />- SKIN: Minor problem with news update lists.<br /><br />Hopefully you&#39;ll find some of the new additions useful.  I&#39;ll be looking at a password recovery tool for the 0.8.2 release down the road.  You can continue to either send me suggestions here, or post them in the forums.',	17,	0),

This will probably be the last announced update for a while, as larger changes are made in the background offsite.  You can still make suggestions during this time.  Here&#39;s what&#39;s changed since 0.8.1.<br /><br /><u>Features:</u><br />- FEATURE: Advanced Search<br />- FEATURE: Lost Password Recovery feature. Recovery link will be mailed to email address on file. Also can recover lost usernames.<br />- FEATURE: Comment quoting via a button and inline quoting via the quote tag<br />- FEATURE: Guest sessions are tracked, and anti-abuse measures prevent scripts from boosting download counts on submissions.<br />- FEATURE: If a registered user falls into a banned IP range by accident, their account can be whitelisted to give them unrestricted access, even with a banned IP.<br />- FEATURE: IPs are logged with additional records, such as comments.<br />- FEATURE: ACP - Blacklist and whitelist <br /><br /><u>Bugs Fixed:</u><br />- SITE: Blacklist would block members, but resulted in a PHP error.<br />- SITE: BBCode is couldn&#39;t be used in the Message System.<br />- SITE: Relevance is consistant accross multiple search pages<br />- SITE: Opening files from location in Internet Explorer caused them to be corrupt.<br />- SITE: The page numbers in My Submission didn&#39;t link correctly.<br />- SITE: Dates on submission pages didn&#39;t obey timezone settings.<br />- SITE: &quot;New Messages&quot; messages would sometimes link to other user&#39;s messages, and give an error.<br />- SKIN: The classic skin was missing the comment edit icon.<br /><br />As always, please tell me if any new bugs crop up, or if something (like downloads) aren&#39;t working for you.  You can send me messages here, on the forum, on taloncrossing, wherever.

The theme of this update is handling the large ammounts of activity that I never expected.  Usability and appearence should be noticably improved in a few areas.<br /><br />Here&#39;s a rundown on the features and improvements:<br />* The pagination has been changed to a condensed format typical of most modern message boards.<br />* Only the most recent 2 version updates are displayed on a submission&#39;s page.  The rest are viewed by opening a new window.<br />* Comments are now paginated, with 40 displayed per page.  This will speed up submissions with hundreds of comments.<br />* Comment pagination contains a &quot;Last Unread&quot; link that will take you to comments made since your last visit.<br />* You can now turn off the &quot;comment received on your submission&quot; feature<br />* To help save more space in your inbox,  you can be alerted of all comments on your work recieved while offline in a single digest.  This is the default setting.<br />* Text box sizes have been increased for comments.<br />* You can now view submissions even while they&#39;re in the queue for updates.  No more &quot;you can&#39;t go there&quot; messages!<br /><br />Bug fixes:<br />* You will no longer recieve messages when you comment on your own work.<br /><br />** At least one user has complained that they&#39;ve lost a review, because they spent more than an hour writing it, and the board returned an error.  I have not been able to reproduce this on the test site.  As a precaution however, if a &quot;request did not originate&quot; error comes up when you submit anything, there will be a link to recover the data you entered.<br /><br />Hopefully no new bugs have appeared, but this hasn&#39;t received very extensive testing.  Send me a message if you encounter any.  Enjoy the updates.  As always I accept feature and improvement suggestions.',	12,	0),

However, it is certainly one of the better hammer swinging Mario games. ',	'-The storyline is told quite well.',	'-Cliched hammer based gameplay.\r\n-Level design could have been better.\r\n-Quite frustrating difficulty.\r\n-Skipping glitch when music restarts.',	'Mario\'s Mansion is another fangame based entirely around the use of a hammer.  The control is pretty good, due to the fact that you may simply hold \"ctrl\" to repeatedly swing your hammer, rather than constantly mashing your keyboard apart if you ever needed to smash something quite a few times. At first, the level design is rather bland, and the gameplay is quite boring, but that improves as you progress through the game. The boss battles are well done, and nowhere near as frustrating as those of MLTCO, thanks to a heart system that allows Mario to take more than one hit. All in all, the gameplay is average, and slightly better than most other hammer-based games. \r\n',	'Everyone knows that sprite. Yes, it is Ninja\'s hand drawn Paper Mario sprite, as seen in every other hammer-based fanmade game. It is a very offical looking fan sprite, yes, though its highly overused. As for the other graphics, they mix decently. \r\n',	'Mario sounds as always, no problem with that. HOWEVER, there is an annoying glitch caused when a MIDI starts or restarts: a few seconds of gameplay are skipped on your screen, though not in the game itself. This can cause major problems, often Mario\'s death. \r\n',	'The game can take you quite a while, due to the fact that the challenge increases a bit too much as you progress through the game. Once you beat Mario\'s Mansion, there is really no need to come back to it. This is partially because you\'ll be glad you\'re done with that pain-in-the-arse final stage, and because the game ends in a cliffhanger - you will not feel like playing MM again, but rather go right on to playing MM2. \r\n',	7,	7,	4,	1,	5),

Hammer based gameplay is still old.',	'Recall the gameplay from the first Mario\'s Mansion. Well... it is the same in Mario\'s Mansion 2. BUT, don\'t be turned off by that fact, you will find some unique new elements in the second Mario\'s mansion. First of all, it seems the difficulty has been toned down a bit. That is a good choice on Fanguy\'s side, because MM2 is nowhere near as frustrating as its predicessor. However, that doesn\'t stop it from putting up a good challenge! A little bit of challenge is a good thing, and MM2 presents a good challenge minus all the frustration. However, a small amount of frustration within the game may still exist, though not to the extent of MM1. The level design is also much more appealing. The first level is especially, a compilation of Mario levels past, is enjoyable, unlike the dark, boring basement level of the first MM. Unique elements are thrown in again for good measure: For example, in the ice level, you are followed around by a flame enemy, which you will actually want to lure to an ice wall that it will melt for you. The boss battles are still unique in their own ways, and you can now actually tell how many hits they will need before their defeat. All in all, MM2 is quite a bit better than MM1, and an enjoyable yet challenging hammer swingin\' good time. \r\n ',	'A decent mix of ripped graphics, along with the custom Paper Mario Sprite you know and love (or hate, due to the fact that it has been used one too many times).

Pretty good, all in all. \r\n',	'Still the average Mario sounds, no problems there. But, it still has that cursed midi starting glitch? (See MM1 review.) That bumps the score down quite a bit. \r\n ',	'With a bit more levels than the first, and a good challenge, it may take a while to complete. But, unlike the first, you may want to go back to levels occasionally during boredom, due to their uniqueness.
